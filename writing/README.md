This is where drafts and presentations (lab meetings, posters etc.) on the project go. This can include a separate directory for each submission.

For example:

```
|_writing
    |_neuroecon_conference_2023
        |_abstract.txt
        |_Neuroecon_2023_overtrained_decisions_poster.pdf
    |_psych_sci
        |_draft.pdf
        |_response_to_reviewers.pdf
    |_RangelLabMeeting
        |_May2023_overtrained_decisions_lab_meeting.ppt
```
