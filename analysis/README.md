This is where code and outputs related to behavior (choice, RT, computational models) would go.

At minimum (i.e. if a Docker image for the project has not yet been created) this should contain some information on the libraries/packages and their versions required to run the code.

For R a most primitive way of doing this would be `sessionInfo()`

For python one rudimentary way would be `pip freeze > requirement.txt`
