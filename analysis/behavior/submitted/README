This can include a separate directory for each submission.

For example:

```
|_submitted
    |_NeuroeconConference
        |_run_all_analyses.R
    |_PsychSci
    |_ELife
```

where `run_all_analyses.R` would source in functions from `behavior/analysis/helpers`, data from `behavior/inputs`, intermediate outputs (e.g. model fits that take too long to run) from `behavior/outputs` and code snippets from notebooks in `behavior/analysis/notebooks`
